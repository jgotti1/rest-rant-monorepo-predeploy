### Setup

Next `cd` into `backend` and run `npm install` to install dependencies for the API.

Next, `cd` into `frontend`, and run `npm install` to install dependencies for the React app.


You will need a Postgres database to connect to. 
Follow instructions here to setup the database and save credentials for the next step.



Next create a `.env` file inside of `backend`. It will need to contain the following environment variables (change the values for the database to match what you defined in the previous step)

```
PORT=5000
DB_USERNAME=rest_rant_user
DB_PASSWORD=(yourpassword)
DB_DATABASE=restRantDB
```


Finally, in separate terminals, run `npm start` in each folder so that the API and React app are running at the same time.
